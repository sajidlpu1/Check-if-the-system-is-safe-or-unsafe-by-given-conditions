# Check-if-the-system-is-safe-or-unsafe-by-given-conditions
 Consider that a system has P resources of same type. These resources are shared by Q processes time to time. All processes request and release the resources one at a time. Generate a solution to demonstrate that, the system is in safe state when following conditions are satisfied. Conditions: a.) Maximum resource need of each process is between 1 and P.b.) Summation of all maximum needs is less than P+Q.
